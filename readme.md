# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementations

This repository contains my personal implementations of various data structures, algorithms, and solutions to classic computational problems (e.g., the **Knapsack Problem**). All code is written in Python and will be periodically updated as I explore new topics or refine existing solutions.

## Key Features
- **Diverse Topics**: Covers fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.), algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming), and well-known problems.
- **Clean Code**: Each implementation prioritizes readability, modularity, and adherence to best practices.
- **Practical Examples**: Solutions include explanations and example usage to demonstrate functionality.
- **Progress Tracking**: The repository will expand over time with new implementations and optimizations.

## Repository Structure
The code is organized into folders by category:
```
├── Data_structures/ # Core data structures
│ ├── linked_list/ # Singly/Doubly linked lists
│ ├── tree/ # Binary trees, AVL trees, etc.
│ └── graph/ # Graph representations and utilities
│
├── Algorithms/ # Algorithmic techniques and implementations
│ ├── sorting/ # Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.)
│ ├── searching/ # Search algorithms (BFS, DFS, etc.)
│ └── dynamic_programming/ # DP solutions to optimization problems
│
└── Problems/ # Solutions to specific computational problems
│ ├── knapsack/ # Knapsack problem implementations
│ ├── shortest_path/ # Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, etc.
│ ├── ... # More to come!
